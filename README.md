# Crystal OpenGL Tutorials

OpenGL tutorials based on [open.gl](https://open.gl/) converted into Crystal programming language. Right now, there are two tutorials available, giving you a chance to create context in GLFW and draw a triangle.

Tutorials were successfully tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04.

In order to run them you need to install GLFW3 development package. On some systems you might also need a development package of GLEW, however it wasn't needed to run examples on Ubuntu.

## Ubuntu configuration:
`sudo apt install libglfw3-dev`

After that, all you need to do is to run example code using Crystal compiler like this:

`crystal context_creation.cr`

## Help
If you have any problems running examples, especially on systems different than Ubuntu, don't hesitate to create an issue on GitHub.

## Contributing
Any kind of help is very much appreciated, please feel free to create a Pull Request with translation of another tutorial or with any other kind of useful information.
